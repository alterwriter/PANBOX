First public PANBOX agent preview for Linux, macOS, and Windows on amd64 and arm64.

- VACCIN uses built-in source rules for selected Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go patterns.
- ENETRON parses pinned npm, PyPI, and Go dependencies and queries an OSV-compatible advisory API. Advisory data is fetched from OSV by default; this is not an offline SCA database.
- The agent can run in a local or self-hosted CI runner for any Git repository. GitHub and GitLab examples are in `deploy/`.
- The dashboard is distributed separately with Docker Compose and PostgreSQL. These assets are CLI/agent binaries only.

This is a narrow preview, not broad SAST/SCA coverage. See the README for supported patterns and manifest formats.
